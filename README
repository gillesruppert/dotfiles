There is no place like home
===========================

This is just a collection of my . files. I tend to change stuff in there on a regular and they are set up to work on my OSX systems.
You are free to use these settings as inspiration or even copy them, but please make sure you remove my name & email (especially in the gitconfig).

I have all my settings in Dropbox so they get automatically synchronised between home & work. The reason I have it on github as well is:

- version control
- backup
- and I want to get to it easily when I don't have Dropbox

The .vimrc had the most work and consists of shortcuts I added over time and things I have seen on the interwebs.

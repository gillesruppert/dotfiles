There is no place like home
===========================

Collection of my . files. This has only been really tested on OSX, although it
should work with maybe some tweeting on Linux distros.

- customised .bashrc
- bash\_aliases
- env
- config that sets up the prompt just the way I like it
- base .jshintrc settings
- .gitconfig
- global .gitignore

## Installation
```bash
make install
```

This will backup any files that are in the home directory and that would be
overwritten by the script into the `DOTFILES\_BACKUP`.

Just follow the directions on screen.
